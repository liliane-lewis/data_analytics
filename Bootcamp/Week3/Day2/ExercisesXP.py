#    Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
#    Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
#    Those three cats are Sara’s pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, 
#    and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
#    Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

#Exercise 2 : Dogs
#Instructions
#
#    Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
#    Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
#        bark: returns a string which states: “<dog_name> is barking”.
#        run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
#        fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a
#  string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.
#
#   Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

#Exercise 4 : Family
#Instructions
#
#    Create a class called Family and implement the following attributes:
#        members: list of dictionaries
#        last_name : (string)
#
#    Implement the following methods:
#        born: adds a child to the members list (use **kwargs), don’t forget to print a message congratulating the family.
#        is_18: takes the name of a family member as a parameter and returns True if they are over 18 and False if not.
#        family_presentation: a method that prints the family’s last name and all the members’ details.
#
#    Create an instance of the Family class, with the last name of your choice, and the below members. 
#    Then call all the methods you created in Point 2.
#
#        [
#           {'name':'Michael','age':35,'gender':'Male','is_child':False},
#            {'name':'Sarah','age':32,'gender':'Female','is_child':False}

#Exercise 5 : TheIncredibles Family
#Instructions
#
#    Create a class called TheIncredibles. This class should inherit from the Family class:
#    This is no random family they are an incredible family, therefore the members attributes, will be a list 
# of dictionaries containing the additional keys : power and incredible_name. (See Point 4)
#
#    Add a method called use_power, this method should print the power of a member only if they are over 18 years old. 
# If not raise an exception (look up exceptions) which stated they are not over 18 years old.

#    Add a method called incredible_presentation which :
#        Print a sentence like “*Here is our powerful family **”
#        Prints the family’s last name and all the members’ details (ie. use the super() function, to call the 
# family_presentation method)
#
#
#    Create an instance of the Incredibles class, with the “Incredibles” last name, and the below members.
#
#        [
#            {'name':'Michael','age':35,'gender':'Male','is_child':False,'power': 'fly','incredible_name':'MikeFly'},
#            {'name':'Sarah','age':32,'gender':'Female','is_child':False,'power': 'read minds','incredible_name':'SuperWoman'}
#        ]
#
#
#    Call the incredible_presentation method.
#
#    Use the born method inherited from the Family class to add Baby Jack with the following power: “Unknown Power”.
#
#    Call the incredible_presentation method again.
